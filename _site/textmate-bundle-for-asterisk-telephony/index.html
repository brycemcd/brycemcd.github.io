<p>I’ve been getting more and more familiar with Asterisk I’ve been
blindly editing the configuration files in TextMate with no context
highlighting. This produced lots of really unnecessary errors. So, <a href="http://www.github.com/brycem/asterisk-textmate-bundle">I
decided to build a bundle from
scratch</a>.</p>

<p>It’s definitely a work in progress and I’d appreciate any work anyone
else would like to put into it</p>
