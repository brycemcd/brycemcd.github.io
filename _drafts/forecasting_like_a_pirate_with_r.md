[Dave McClure's AARRR
framework](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-nov-2012)
use a useful starting place for developing an online product and
understanding if you're doing a good job.

It's a starting place and if you think you'll need to raise outside
funding to scale your product you need a defensible position for your
valuation. Often early valuation is directly tied to initial traction of
the product, overall market size and the composition of the executive team. AARRR
helps develop a sense for the initial traction of the product.

As you build the case for how much cash you need to get to your next
funding milestone, you'll naturally need to model your cash spend.
Modeling involves many assumptions with many unknowns but you'll need to
come up with "a number" for the raise.

The budget for growth in particular is important to get right. Too high
and you're giving up too much equity. Too low and your little company
that could have been runs out of cash before the next funding milestone.
Rather than pull a single reasonable guess out of the air, the founding team 
can apply some math to come up with a distribution for the costs of growth and
then apply a confident estimate given the operating parameters. Let's
apply forecasting like a pirate.

## Pirate Step 1 - Acquisition and Activation

Growing a product starts with attracting attention. The growth team will
have to come up with a mixture of different acquisition sources
(blogger outreach, PPC, SEO, more creative channels) and instrument them
to understand which sources are worth the investment.
